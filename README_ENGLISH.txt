# Https_File_Transfer

A (basic) file server secured by the HTTPS protocol.

A (basic) client for this file server.

#Server
The server is developed by Composition with the com.sun.net.httpserver.HttpsServer class. It recognizes the following query parameters:

Upload must allow the client to send to the server the contents of the file whose l.

Download will return to the client the contents of the file whose name will be the value of the download parameter.

Constraints

The client and the server will have to perform mutual authentication, the server will have to identify with the client and the client will have to identify with the server. For this identification, the server and client certificates must be able to be generated by the application. If the server URL changes, the application must be able to generate a new server certificate as a result of this change. Moreover, for a new client to be able to connect to the server to deposit / retrieve files, it is necessary that the application can generate a certificate for this new client.

#Client 

The client will be essentially developed using the javax.net.HttpsURLConnection API which belongs to 'javax.net.ssl API. This client will send to the server HTTP GET requests with upload or download defined above and will exploit the response returned by the server.

In the case of a request to send a file to the server (via the upload parameter), if the file already exists on the server, then its contents will be updated. If it does not already exist on the server, then it will be added to the server's database.

In the case of a file retrieval request from the server (via the download parameter), if the requested file is actually available from the server then the client will have to be able to retrieve it and store it.
